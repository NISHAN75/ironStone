									<h5>From Idaho to Ironstone</h5>
									<div class="team-member-details-inner-info mb-p">
										<p>I grew up on a 10-acre farm in Nampa, Idaho, about 20 miles west of Boise. My father was an Army veteran-turned-local-postmaster, my mother was a homemaker who cared for me and my two older sisters. When I was six, we lost Dad. It was a beautiful summer day. I was on the porch swing with my big sister when the police car arrived. Two people got out and knocked on the door of our house.</p>
										<p>That day changed everything.</p>
										<p>My Mom was a true Southern belle, but suddenly, she was a single mother with just a high school education and a family to support. So she went to college, got her bachelor’s and master’s degrees as a Special Education teacher, and furthered her career to become a reading specialist. When I was in third grade, Mom sent me to school in a cab because she had to get to class, too. I joke that I’m the first person who ever “Ubered.” She knew first-hand that a high school diploma wasn’t enough and made it clear to me and my sisters, “You will go to college.” It was an order – not an option.</p>
										<p>After graduating from Northwest Nazarene University, I worked in banking in Boise and Salt Lake City. Several years later, I was living in Atlanta, but commuting to Connecticut every week for my job. I remember sitting on my bed at the Marriott Courtyard, eating yet another room service burger and fries for dinner while watching a movie on TV when I thought, “How can I use my background in financial services and my experience as an executive coach to help people and businesses succeed?”</p>
										<p>At that moment, the idea for Ironstone was born.</p>
										<p>Ironstone emerged from Andrea’s driving passion: to bring out the best in everyone she meets.</p>
